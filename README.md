## About Us
The Ministry of Technology works towards ensuring a reliable and secure assistive technology infrastructure that improves the academic and institutional life at the university. Through the provision of technological solutions to student issues and the improvement of pre-existing technology infrastructure on campus to improve efficiency, convenience, and environment-consciousness, the Ministry is committed to making our campus more environmentally and technologically friendly.

## Purpose
Our purpose is to develop sustainable, scalable and user-friendly technology solutions, measure impact, improvise and adapt. We develop technology for a diverse set of users â€“ from students to support staff, and incorporate all stakeholders' feedback. We firmly believe in clever design and meticulous systems.

## Ongoing Projects
- **[Mailroom Digitisation]**: The Ashoka University Mailroom, which formerly processed all incoming and outgoing packages by hand on paper, now uses our end-to-end online portal. This is used by both students and support staff members, and records 500+ packages every day.
- **[Events Calendar]**: We are developing a comprehensive, organised calendar with a view of all events happening at Ashoka University. This will be updated automatically based on emails received by the student body, and automatically send invitations to concerned event organisers.
